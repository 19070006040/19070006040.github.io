#Trendyol

In the project of the Se-3355 course, I attempted to design a website similar to Trendyol using Django with the Python language. I designed the HTML part of my website using Bootstrap. Using the Django admin interface,
I organized the information of the products on my page, including images, names, descriptions, prices, and categories.On my website, users can see the best-selling products on the homepage along with their images, prices, 
and partial descriptions. They can click on the desired product to read a detailed description and add it to their cart using the 'Add to Cart' button. On the homepage, with the product and category search tab at the top, 
users can search for a specific product by its name and access directly the detail page of that product, or access all products in the category by searching for that category.
